# Quantum Neural Network (QNN) – AFIR 10 Dataset

**Status:** Work-in-Progress / Experimental

This repository contains an **experimental implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN)** applied to the AFIR 10 dataset. While some functionality is currently broken, the project highlights research-oriented coding, hybrid classical-quantum techniques, and exploratory problem-solving.

## Project Goals

* Implement a QNN to classify data from the AFIR 10 dataset.
* Explore encoding classical input features into qubits.
* Experiment with quantum entanglement strategies to improve feature interactions.
* Investigate quantum-inspired activation functions (e.g., sigmoid thresholds on qubit measurements).
* Document challenges encountered when combining quantum circuits with classical dataset workflows.

## Current Status

* QNN structure implemented with basic forward pass.
* Dataset loading and preprocessing integrated.
* Some quantum operations or output measurements may fail; full training pipeline is not yet stable.


## Future Work / TODOs

* Fix broken quantum operations.
* Implement a complete, stable training and evaluation pipeline.
* Add detailed examples and visualizations of QNN outputs.
* Benchmark against classical neural network models on the AFIR 10 dataset.


## Contributions are welcome for experimental improvements, bug fixes, or discussion on QNN design strategies. This project is intended as a research exploration rather than production-ready code.
